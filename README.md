Plus few extra widgets and tweaks...

Focus on simplicity, ease of use and modularity.
Despite its rich features, the plugin contains few lines of code and is very light...
This is possible because each functionnality/module keep it as simple and straightforward as possible.

Most of these functionnalities are called 'modules', so it does what you expect... For example, if you have already a favorite slider plugin, you easily can disable the Slider module by clicking the checkbox and you're good to go :)

Particularly suited for users who need required functionnalities to build their e-commerce but don't like to use many bloated and heavy plugins on their Wordpress install. When you build a new e-commerce, it's also very convenient to install most of what you need in one time...
