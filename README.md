Storefront Service Pack Beta adds modulable fundamental functionnalities and SEO enhancements to your WooCommerce/Storefront site.

Includes all basic functionalities a e-commerce should have:

- Newsletter Subscriber
- Contact Form
- Slider
- Order Tracking
- Store Credit
- Post and Review Aggregator
- Product and Post Sharer
- Floating Menu
- Dynamic Sidebar
- Json LD Data Structurer

Plus few extra widgets and little functionalities...

Focus on simplicity, modularity, commodity and extension.
Despite its rich features, the plugin contains few lines of code and is very light...
This is possible because each functionnality/module keep it as simple and straightforward as possible.

Most of these functionnalities are modulable... For example, if you have already your favorite slider plugin, you easily can disable the Slider module by clicking the checkbox and you're good to go.

Particularly suited for users who need the required functionnalities for their e-commerce but don't like to use many bloated/heavy plugins on their Wordpress install. When you build a new e-commerce, it's also very convenient to install most of what you need in one time...
